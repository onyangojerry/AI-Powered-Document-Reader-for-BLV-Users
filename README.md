# 👁️‍🗨️ AI-Powered Document Reader for Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) Users

This project is a web-based tool that helps low-vision users interpret complex documents that include both text and images.

It uses:
- 🧠 [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to extract text from images and PDFs
- 🤖 [Hugging Face BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) (coming soon) for image captioning
- 🌐 [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) or [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (coming soon) for an accessible web interface

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Make digital documents accessible to blind and low-vision users
- Provide audio + text output for both written and visual content
- Support real-world formats like PDFs, screenshots, and scanned pages
